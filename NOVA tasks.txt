NOVA tasks

* PLAYER MUST BE SCREEN BOUNDED!

PLAYER DEATH
* need a SPECIAL bigger explosion for the player
  ! the original uses a big central explosion and three small ones, on the nose and wings




Bouncing Balls (Level 3)
- get sprites
- create a single baddie with new behaviour
- initial velocity should have some random component
- random component to the rebound, too, they can come away with MORE energy
- they DO animate according to their direction of travel

- Starfield!

Scene management
- Loader scene, very minimal
- Splash screen, quite minimal but will need:
  - fading
  - input to permit us to move forwards to the game
  * possibly (later) make it alternate to the highscore screen? (and/or attract mode)
  * starfield

* Perhaps explosions should have a time delay parameter so clusters can be made all at once

- Bouncers need to take two shots (note: not sure they did, actually, but hey ho)


Lives manager
- need an initial number of lives
- Remove a life each time we die
- and turn off one of the lives sprites
- must be able to reset the lives by turning all the sprites back on
  - and of course restoring the max number of lives
- must know when we've died our last time
  - for now, just spit out some debug

- On death:
  - spawn explosion
  - need to hide the player
  - can't shoot when dead :)
  - need a timer for when the player's killed (for now, use the same max value as between waves)
  - clean up the old wave
  - decrease number of lives

- want to be able to kill aliens
  - so the hit detection must tell them to die
  - which should trigger their explosion (and later explosion GROUP)
  - active aliens should add themselves into a list in the wave manager
  - when they die, they should remove themselves from the list
  - debug output the number as they add themselves
  - debug output the number as they are killed

SPAWNING
  - must spawn just the 1st wave of aliens for now
  - when it's depleted to zero, spawn the next list
    - perhaps a short timer between waves? but the delay in the wavemanager
  - when we're out of waves, for now just debug GAME FINISHED or similar

WAVES actually doing things:

- create a movement script for the 1st wave
  - start moving in a direction (set by an editor parameter)
  - according to direction, also check for screen side collision
  - first move down (will need to calc our descend-to height)
  - then move back up (will need to store our origin height)


  - occasionally emit shots
    - will need a baddy shot pool
