NOVA tasks


PLAYER DEATH
* need a SPECIAL bigger explosion for the player
* need an initial number of lives
* On death:
  * spawn explosion
  * need to hide the player
  * can't shoot when dead :)
  * need a timer for when the player's killed (for now, use the same max value as between waves)
  * clean up the old wave
  * decrease number of lives

  * Perhaps explosions should have a time delay parameter so clusters can be made all at once















- want to be able to kill aliens
  - so the hit detection must tell them to die
  - which should trigger their explosion (and later explosion GROUP)
  - active aliens should add themselves into a list in the wave manager
  - when they die, they should remove themselves from the list
  - debug output the number as they add themselves
  - debug output the number as they are killed

SPAWNING
  - must spawn just the 1st wave of aliens for now
  - when it's depleted to zero, spawn the next list
    - perhaps a short timer between waves? but the delay in the wavemanager
  - when we're out of waves, for now just debug GAME FINISHED or similar

WAVES actually doing things:

- create a movement script for the 1st wave
  - start moving in a direction (set by an editor parameter)
  - according to direction, also check for screen side collision
  - first move down (will need to calc our descend-to height)
  - then move back up (will need to store our origin height)


  - occasionally emit shots
    - will need a baddy shot pool
